<h1><em>Bhutan, The Land Of Happiness</em></h1>
<img src="bhutan.jpg.jpg">
<p>Bhutan is a captivating landlocked country in South Asia's eastern Himalayas.Bhutan, a landlocked country nestled on the eastern ridges of the Himalayas, exudes a captivating blend of ancient heritage and modern transitions. Historically, Bhutan remained a remote kingdom, shielded from the modern world until the 1960s. However, with improved transportation, the pace of change accelerated. What once took six days by mule from the Indian border to the Bhutanese capital, Thimphu, can now be covered in a few hours by car along winding mountain roads. Bhutan’s economic core lies in the fertile valleys of the Lesser Himalayas, while its political nucleus centers around the Paro and Thimphu valleys. This strategically located nation, nestled between the Assam-Bengal Plain of India and the Plateau of Tibet in southwestern China, carries considerable geopolitical significance. Bhutan’s rich cultural heritage, strongly rooted in Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism, remains evident, preserved by its isolation and reverence for tradition.</p>
<p>Some intriguing aspects that make Bhutan stand out:</p>
<ol>1)	<u><strong>Buddhist Kingdom</u></strong>: Bhutan is the world’s last Buddhist kingdom, steeped in ancient traditions and spiritual practices. Its serene monasteries, fluttering prayer flags, and prayer wheels evoke a sense of tranquility.</ol>
                                                                         <img src="CHorten.jpg">

</ul>

   </ul>	
   <ul>C)Challenges and Progress:
        <li>	Political instability surfaced occasionally, including the murder of the prime minister in 1964 and an unsuccessful assassination attempt on the king in 1965.</li>

    </ul>
    <ul> D)	Hereditary Monarchy:
        <li>	In 1972, Jigme Singye Wangchuk ascended the throne at the age of 16. He continued his father’s policies, emphasizing development, infrastructure, and health.</li>
        <li>	Bhutan’s rich cultural heritage and natural environment were also priorities.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>E)	Democratization and Shared Power:

        <li>	While the king still wielded significant power, he shared it with the Council of Ministers. The assembly gained the ability to call for a vote of confidence on the monarch.</li>
        </ul>

    <ol><u><strong>3)Culture and Traditions of Bhutan</strong></u></ol>
<p>While Bhutan is one of the smallest countries in the world, its cultural diversity and richness are profound.As such, strong emphasis is laid on the promotion and preservation of its unique culture. By protecting and nurturing Bhutan’s living culture it is believed that it will help guard the sovereignty of the nation.</p>
<ul><u>Eating Habits</u>
<li>Traditional Bhutanese eating habits are simple and, in general, food is eaten with hands. Family members eat while sitting cross legged on the wooden floor with food first being served to the head of the household first.
    	Traditionally dishes were cooked in earthenware, but with the easy availability of modern goods, pots and pans have largely replaced their use. A typical Bhutanese meal consists of rice, a dish of Ema Datshi, the country’s favourite dish of chili and cheese, pork, beef curry or lentils.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><u>Funeral</u></ul>
<li>Death signifies re-birth or a mere passing on to a new life. In keeping with the traditions, elaborate rituals are performed to ensure a safe passage and a good rebirth.
    Bhutanese typically bury their dead while the Brokpas carry out ‘Sky Burials’, a process in which the deceased are prepared and left atop mountains to be devoured by vultures in a final act of compassion and generosity.</li>
    <li>Elaborate and ancient rituals are also conducted on the anniversary of the death with the erection of prayer flags. The relatives and people of the locality come with alcohol, rice or other sundry items to attend such rituals.</li>

    <ul><u>Birth</u></ul>
    <li>The birth of a child is always welcomed. In Bhutan extended family and guests are discouraged from visiting during the first three days after the birth.</li>
<li>The child is not immediately named; this responsibility is usually entrusted to the head lama (Buddhist priest) of the local temple. The mother and child will also receive blessings from the local deity (natal deity) and it was traditional that the name associated with the deity is given.</li>
    <li>In some cases, the child is given the name of the day on which the child is born. Based on the Bhutanese calendar, a horoscope is written based on the time and date of the birth, this will detail the various rituals to be performed at different times in the life of the child and to an extent predict his or her future.</li>

<ul><u>Marriage</u></ul>
<li>Until just a few decades ago arranged marriages were common and many married among their relatives. In eastern Bhutan cross-cousin marriages were also once common, however, this practice is now becoming less common place among the literate masses and most marriages are based on the choice of the individuals.</li>
<li>Marriages are simple affairs and are usually kept low-key. However, elaborate rituals are performed for lasting unions between the bride and the bridegroom. As the religious ceremony comes to an end, parents, relatives and friends of the couple present the newlyweds with traditional offerings of scarves along with gifts in the form of cash and goods.</li>
